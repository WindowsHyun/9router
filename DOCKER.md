# Docker

Run 9Router in a container. Published image: [`decolua/9router`](https://hub.docker.com/r/decolua/9router) — multi-platform `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`.

---

# 👤 For Users

## Quick start

`docker run` gives you the router on its own. **`docker compose up` gives you the
router plus the two providers that need something installed locally** — Claude
Code and the ChatGPT Web bridge — which is what most people want:

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # set JWT_SECRET; see the notes in that file
docker compose up -d
```

> First run builds two images and takes several minutes: the router (so Claude
> Code is inside it — the published image is upstream's and has no Claude Code)
> and the bridge (Chromium, Electron and a virtual display). Give Docker at
> least 4 GB of memory for the router's Next.js build.

Open http://localhost:20128.

Router only, no local providers:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 20128:20128 \
  -v "$HOME/.9router:/app/data" \
  -e DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  --name 9router \
  decolua/9router:latest
```

App listens on port `20128`. Open: http://localhost:20128

## Reaching the provider cards remotely

The Claude Code and ChatGPT Web cards drive routes that are normally
restricted to loopback, because on a desktop they can spawn a process or open
a window. In a container that restriction only gets in the way — there is no
desktop behind them — so it is lifted automatically when 9Router detects
`/.dockerenv` or `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`. Dashboard authentication still
applies.

If you run 9Router outside a container but reach the dashboard from another
machine, set it explicitly:

```yaml
    environment:
      NINEROUTER_HOST_ROUTES_REMOTE: "1"
```

`0` forces the loopback rule back on.

## The two local providers

### Claude Code CLI — bundled in the image

`@anthropic-ai/claude-code` is installed in the image, so the **claude-cli**
provider works with nothing else to install. It runs `claude -p` instead of
replaying OAuth tokens, which is the point: traffic looks like an ordinary
Claude Code session.

The container has no terminal for the sign-in TUI, so an account is attached
with a token instead. On any machine that already has Claude Code:

```bash
claude setup-token          # prints a long-lived token
```

Then in the dashboard: **Providers → Claude Code CLI (-p) → Claude Code
accounts → paste the token**. Add several tokens for several accounts;
9Router falls back between them like any other provider.

> Each account is one token (in a container) or one Claude Code config
> directory (on a desktop). Both are per-connection, so accounts never share
> credentials.

### ChatGPT Web — a sidecar container

The bridge drives a real chatgpt.com session in a browser, on a bare virtual
display — **no Electron launcher, no desktop, no VNC**. You sign it in from
the 9Router dashboard by handing it your chatgpt.com session; nothing inside
the container is ever something you connect to.

(Fully headless is available as `BRIDGE_HEADLESS=1`, but it is not the
default: upstream never runs that mode, so chatgpt.com's bot detection and the
bridge's own automation are both untested on it.)

```bash
docker compose up -d        # builds the bridge image on first run (a few minutes)
```

Then, **once**:

1. In a browser where you are signed in to chatgpt.com, open devtools →
   Application → Cookies → `https://chatgpt.com`, and copy the value of
   `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`. It is httpOnly, so `document.cookie`
   will not show it; a cookie-extension export works too.
2. Dashboard → **ChatGPT Web** → paste it → **Connect**.

The bridge writes the session and then opens your account in its own browser
to check it, so "Signed in" means ChatGPT actually accepted it. The session is
kept in the `9router-chatgpt-web-profile` volume.

9Router reaches the bridge at `http://chatgpt-web:17851` over the compose
network — 17851, not 17841, because the bridge pins its own listen address to
`127.0.0.1` and a sibling container cannot reach that; `BRIDGE_PUBLISH_PORT`
forwards it. (In Kubernetes the bridge is a sidecar sharing the router's
network namespace, so there it is plain `http://127.0.0.1:17841` with no
forwarder.) The session endpoint on `17842` binds the interface itself and
needs no forwarding.

Neither port is published to your machine. There is nothing to open: signing
in happens in the dashboard.

**Already running the desktop launcher on your host?** Skip the sidecar and
point the router at it instead:

```yaml
    environment:
      CHATGPT_WEB_BASE_URL: http://host.docker.internal:17841
```

9Router accepts any loopback, container or private-network address for the
bridge and refuses public ones, so the session cannot leave your network.


## Manage container

```bash
docker logs -f 9router        # view logs
docker stop 9router           # stop
docker start 9router          # start again
docker rm -f 9router          # remove
```

## Data persistence

```bash
-v "$HOME/.9router:/app/data" \
-e DATA_DIR=/app/data
```

Without `DATA_DIR`, the app falls back to `~/.9router/` (macOS/Linux) or `%APPDATA%\9router\` (Windows). In the container, `DATA_DIR=/app/data` makes the bind mount work.

Data layout under `$DATA_DIR/`:

```text
$DATA_DIR/
├── db/
│   ├── data.sqlite       # main SQLite database
│   └── backups/          # auto backups
└── ...                   # certs, logs, runtime configs
```

Host path: `$HOME/.9router/db/data.sqlite`
Container path: `/app/data/db/data.sqlite`

## Optional env vars

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 20128:20128 \
  -v "$HOME/.9router:/app/data" \
  -e DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  -e PORT=20128 \
  -e HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \
  -e DEBUG=true \
  --name 9router \
  decolua/9router:latest
```

## Optional Headroom sidecar

The 9Router image does not bundle Python or Headroom. To use Headroom in Docker, run it as a separate service and point 9Router at that proxy:

```yaml
services:
  9router:
    image: decolua/9router:latest
    ports:
      - "20128:20128"
    volumes:
      - "$HOME/.9router:/app/data"
    environment:
      DATA_DIR: /app/data
      HEADROOM_URL: http://headroom:8787
    depends_on:
      - headroom

  headroom:
    image: ghcr.io/chopratejas/headroom:latest
    ports:
      - "8787:8787"
```

In the dashboard, open `Endpoint` → `Token Saver` → `Headroom`, confirm the URL is `http://headroom:8787`, recheck status, then enable Headroom.

If Headroom runs on the Docker host instead of as a sidecar, use `http://host.docker.internal:8787` on macOS/Windows. On Linux, add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` or the equivalent compose `extra_hosts` entry.

## Update to latest

```bash
docker pull decolua/9router:latest
docker rm -f 9router
# re-run the quick start command
```

To pin a specific version instead of following `latest`, use a numbered image tag:

```bash
docker pull decolua/9router:0.5.81
```

---

# 🛠 For Developers

## Build image locally (test)

```bash
docker build -t 9router .

docker run --rm -p 20128:20128 \
  -v "$HOME/.9router:/app/data" \
  -e DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  9router
```

The Dockerfile uses the official Alpine and npm registries by default. Regional mirrors can be supplied when needed:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg ALPINE_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com \
  --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/ \
  -t 9router .
```

## Publish (automatic via CI)

Push a Docker-safe semver git tag `vX.Y.Z` (or a prerelease such as `vX.Y.Z-rc.1`) → GitHub Actions builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` on native runners, health-checks each platform image, verifies the resulting manifest and `/api/health`, then publishes:

- `ghcr.io/decolua/9router:X.Y.Z` + `:latest`
- `decolua/9router:X.Y.Z` + `:latest`

The `v` prefix is used only for the git tag; image tags omit it. A stable tag push promotes `latest`, but a prerelease tag such as `vX.Y.Z-rc.1` publishes only its numbered image by default. Prereleases require an explicit manual `promote_latest` opt-in. Promotion happens only after both native platform builds, both platform health checks, manifest inspection, and the resolved-manifest smoke test succeed. A failed or timed-out platform build therefore cannot move `latest`.

The workflow rejects SemVer build metadata such as `v1.2.3+build.7` because the `+` form is not a valid Docker image tag. The git tag and both `package.json` versions must match exactly.

```bash
# Use scripts/release.js (recommended)
node scripts/release.js "Release title" "Notes"

# Or manually
git tag v0.5.81 && git push origin v0.5.81
```

To republish an existing tag, run the `Build and Push Docker Image` workflow manually and provide the exact tag, for example `v0.5.81`, in the `release_tag` input. Manual runs publish the numbered tag but leave `latest` unchanged by default:

```text
release_tag:     v0.5.81
promote_latest:  false
```

The `promote_latest` checkbox is an explicit opt-in for changing `latest`. Use it when a deliberate rollback or recovery should make that version the current default:

```text
release_tag:     v0.5.75
promote_latest:  true
```

Numbered image tags are mutable because a republish can replace their manifest. For a deployment that must be immutable, pin the image digest instead:

```bash
docker pull decolua/9router@sha256:<verified-digest>
```

The release workflow runs `/api/health` on each native `amd64` and `arm64` platform image before it uploads the digest artifact or assembles the multi-platform manifest. It then runs a second health check against the resolved version manifest before any requested `latest` promotion.

During recovery, the selected tag remains the application source while the Dockerfile from the workflow revision is used, so an older tag can be rebuilt with the current publishing fixes.

The workflow is tag-driven. Creating a git tag does not automatically create a GitHub Release, so the Releases page and the published package/image tags can be at different versions unless a maintainer creates a release separately.

The upstream repository needs these repository secrets for Docker Hub publishing:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

GHCR publishing uses the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` with package write permission. Forks can publish to their own GHCR namespace, but Docker Hub publication is restricted to the upstream `decolua/9router` repository.

The optional repository variables `ALPINE_MIRROR` and `NPM_REGISTRY` can override the default package mirrors used by the CI Docker build.

Workflow: `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
