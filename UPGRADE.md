# Upgrading this fork

This repository is a fork of **[decolua/9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router)** carrying
features that are not upstream. This document is how you take a new upstream release without
losing them.

What the fork adds — in full in [FORK-CHANGELOG.md](FORK-CHANGELOG.md):

| | |
|---|---|
| `claude-cli` (`ccli`) | Routes through the local `claude -p` binary instead of replaying an OAuth token, which is what makes the plain `claude` provider a ban risk |
| Auto-ping cron | Scheduled keepalive pings ("Only Hi") on a cron, per connection, optionally sent via the Claude Code CLI |
| Agent skills | Install a third-party `SKILL.md` by URL and toggle it per request; injected into the routed prompt |
| Docker packaging | The router image bundles Claude Code, so one install covers it |
| Bridge sign-in console | The router serves the bridge's noVNC window on its own origin behind the dashboard session, so signing in needs no `kubectl port-forward` |

**The short version**

```bash
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --dry-run    # see what is coming
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs              # take the newest upstream tag
```

---

## How the fork is shaped

This matters more than any script: **most of the fork is new files, and new files never conflict.**

- **42 added files** — providers, executors, configs, components, API routes, agent-skill
  storage and injection, local-provider accounts, the bridge's Docker image and its sign-in
  console proxy, tests, this tooling.
  Upstream does not know they exist, so an upgrade cannot break them. They only need to still be
  there afterwards.
- **32 edited upstream files** — almost all of them a handful of lines that *register* the new
  files (an import, a map entry, an array item). These are the only places a conflict can happen.
  The exceptions worth knowing about are `custom-server.js` (it hosts the sign-in console's
  WebSocket, which a Next route handler cannot serve) and `src/dashboardGuard.js` (local-only
  routes have to stay reachable inside a container).
- **2 generated snapshots** — `tests/__baseline__/*.json`. Upstream adds providers too, so
  these conflict on most releases and are **regenerated, never merged**.

`scripts/fork/fork-manifest.mjs` is the machine-readable version of that list and is what every
script below reads. If you add to the fork, add to the manifest.

**What a normal upgrade looks like.** Rehearsed against a synthetic v0.5.82 that bumped the
version, added a provider to both registration files, and edited `custom-server.js` — i.e. it
touched the fork's own conflict surface on purpose:

```
1 upstream commit(s) to take
2 fork commit(s) to replay
✗ merge stopped on conflicts:
  open-sse/providers/registry/index.js
      → ...take upstream's list, then re-add the two fork imports...
42/42 added files present
```

One file needed hands. `package.json`, `custom-server.js` and `open-sse/executors/index.js`
merged cleanly because the edits sat in different regions — that will not always hold, and when it
does not, the tool names each file with its own hint.

---

## First-time setup

Only needed once, and only if the fork's work is not yet on a branch.

```bash
# 1. upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/decolua/9router
git fetch upstream --tags

# 2. commit the work
git add -A ':!.omc'
git commit -m "feat: claude-cli provider and cron auto-ping"

# 3. prove it
node scripts/fork/verify-fork.mjs
```

This repo keeps the fork on `master`, with upstream as a remote — so
`git log master ^upstream/master` answers "what is mine?". A separate branch
works equally well; set `FORK_BRANCH` in the manifest to whichever you use.
The scripts do not depend on the name (see below).

---

## Routine upgrade

```bash
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --dry-run      # what would be taken, nothing touched
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs                # newest upstream tag
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --to v0.6.0    # a specific release
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --to upstream/master
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --rebase       # replay linearly instead of merging
```

The script:

1. refuses to run on a dirty tree or off the fork branch,
2. fetches upstream and shows the incoming commits,
3. creates a rollback branch `fork-backup/<timestamp>`,
4. merges (or, with `--rebase`, replays) — **this is the real work, and it is git's 3-way merge, not a text patcher**,
5. regenerates the baselines and the derived provider icons,
6. runs `verify-fork.mjs` and refuses to call it a success if the fork is not intact.

Rolling back is always `git reset --hard fork-backup/<timestamp>`.

### When it stops on a conflict

The script prints the conflicted files with the per-file hint from the table below, then:

```bash
# resolve the files, then
git add <files>
git commit                     # or: git rebase --continue   (if you used --rebase)
node scripts/fork/upgrade-fork.mjs --finish
```

`--finish` does steps 5 and 6 — regenerate and verify — for a conflict you resolved by hand.

To give up: `git merge --abort` (or `git rebase --abort` with `--rebase`).

---

### Merge, not rebase, by default

The fork arrives on `master` as a merge commit, so the history shows it as one
reviewable change rather than commits pushed straight onto upstream. Rebase
would replay those commits and **drop that merge commit** — git flattens merges
when it replays them — so merging is the default and `--rebase` opts out.

---

## Conflict guidance, file by file

Every one of these is "keep both sides": upstream's change **and** the fork's registration. The
fork almost never replaces upstream code — the one exception is called out.

| File | What the fork put there | On conflict |
|---|---|---|
| `open-sse/providers/registry/index.js` | 1 import + 1 entry in the default-export array | Despite the `Auto-generated` header **there is no generator** — it is hand-maintained. Take upstream's list, then re-add `./claude-cli.js` with a free `pN` index and append it to the array. A collision here is silent at merge time and fatal at boot: two `pN` imports with the same name stop the whole registry loading. |
| `open-sse/executors/index.js` | 1 import + 2 map entries (`claude-cli`, `ccli`) | Keep both next to upstream's. |
| `open-sse/handlers/chatCore/sseToJsonHandler.js` | **Replaces** the final `const finalBody = …` ternary with an if/else that also converts for non-OpenAI clients | The one real replacement. Keep the fork's block; upstream's ternary is what it supersedes. This is a genuine upstream bug fix — see *Sending things upstream* below. |
| `src/shared/services/quotaAutoPing.js` | The whole cron layer: `cronMatcher` import, `sendClaudeCliPing`, `sendPingViaCli` on the claude handler, `readCronEntry`/`runCronPing`, the cron branch in the tick, `deps.providerHandlers` | Largest edit, but purely additive. Keep upstream's changes to the reset-based path and re-add the cron pieces around them. |
| `src/shared/constants/config.js` | `cronPingText`, `cronMaxExpressions`, `cronFailureCooldownMs`, `cliPingTimeoutMs`, `cliPingModel` inside `QUOTA_AUTOPING_CONFIG` | Additive keys. Keep both sides. |
| `src/shared/services/initializeApp.js` | `hasQuotaAutoPingEnabled` also returns true for cron-only setups | Without it a cron schedule does not survive a restart. |
| `src/dashboardGuard.js` | 2 entries in `LOCAL_ONLY_PATHS` | **Security-relevant.** One route spawns a process, the other fetches a URL and can open a window on the host. Dropping them exposes both when `requireLogin` is false. |
| `src/app/api/cli-tools/all-statuses/route.js` | 2 imports + 2 `STATUS_GETTERS` entries | Keep both. |
| `src/shared/constants/cliTools.js` | 2 `CLI_TOOLS` entries before `devin:` | Keep both. |
| `src/shared/components/index.js` | 3 re-exports | Keep both. |
| `…/providers/[id]/ConnectionRow.js` | `autoPingSchedule` prop, its Schedule button, tooltip, propTypes | Keep both. |
| `…/providers/[id]/page.js` | Imports, `cronScheduleTarget` state, `cron` in the auto-ping state and settings load, `handleAutoPingSchedule`, the `autoPingSchedule` prop, the modal, and the two status cards in the `isFreeNoAuth` branch | Most touch points of any file; work through them one at a time. |

`CHANGELOG.md` is deliberately **not** in this list. The fork's entries live in
`FORK-CHANGELOG.md` precisely so upstream's changelog never conflicts.

---

## No fork branch? (fresh clone, or a machine without the history)

```bash
# on the machine that has the fork
node scripts/fork/export-patch.mjs --base v0.5.81     # writes fork.patch

# on the fresh upstream checkout
git apply --3way fork.patch
node scripts/fork/verify-fork.mjs
```

`--3way` is required: a plain `git apply` needs exact context and fails the moment upstream edits a
line near one of ours, while `--3way` does the same merge a rebase would.

`export-patch.mjs` refuses to run while fork files are untracked, because an untracked file is
silently omitted — producing a patch that applies cleanly and still leaves the fork broken.

---

## Verifying

```bash
node scripts/fork/verify-fork.mjs           # structure + registry + fork tests
node scripts/fork/verify-fork.mjs --quick   # skip the test run
node scripts/fork/verify-fork.mjs --live    # also the live `claude -p` tests
```

It checks, in order: every added file is present; every integration marker is still in its upstream
file (and no conflict markers are left behind); the built registry really exposes `claude-cli` and
the fork's five test files pass; the
baselines list both providers.

File presence alone would pass on a half-resolved merge — that is why the registry and test steps
are there.

Beyond the fork's own checks, the repo's normal gates still apply:

```bash
node tests/__baseline__/verify-providers.mjs
node tests/__baseline__/verify-alias.mjs
node tests/__baseline__/verify-oauth-urls.mjs
npx eslint .
```

The full suite is **not** green on a plain checkout (~122 failures upstream, unrelated to the
fork) — see `CLAUDE.md`. Judge a release by whether the failure set *changed*, not by zero.

### The branch name is not load-bearing

`FORK_BRANCH` in the manifest records which branch carries the fork, but
`upgrade-fork.mjs` only refuses a detached HEAD, or a branch with no commits of
its own. Any layout works: the fork on `master` with upstream as a remote (what
this repo does), or on a separate branch. A name that differs from the manifest
is reported, not refused.

### This procedure was rehearsed, not just written

Against a synthetic `v0.5.99` release that edits the same lines the fork does
(a new executor next to ours, a new `LOCAL_ONLY_PATHS` entry, a new autoping key,
and a rewritten `CHANGELOG.md`):

- `upgrade-fork.mjs` stopped on exactly two conflicts — `open-sse/executors/index.js`
  and `src/dashboardGuard.js` — and printed this document's hint for each.
- Both were "keep both sides". After `git rebase --continue`, `--finish` rebuilt the
  baselines and verification passed.
- The patch route was rehearsed too: a patch exported at v0.5.81 applied onto the
  v0.5.99 tree with `git apply --3way` — everything clean but the same two files,
  which `verify-fork.mjs` then refused to pass until they were resolved.

Every conflict seen so far has been additive. If you ever hit one that is not,
the file-by-file table above says which side owns that code.

---

## Things that are rebuilt, not merged

Run automatically by `upgrade-fork.mjs`; here they are for a manual upgrade:

```bash
node tests/__baseline__/snapshot-providers.mjs           # providers-baseline.json
node tests/__baseline__/verify-alias.mjs --snapshot      # alias-baseline.json
cp public/providers/claude.png public/providers/claude-cli.png
```

The baselines are snapshots of "every provider the app knows". Upstream adds providers in most
releases, so merging them is meaningless — rebuild and commit.

---

## Configuration the fork adds

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLI_CLAUDE_BIN` | auto-detected | Path to the `claude` binary |
| `CLI_CLAUDE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Concurrent `claude -p` processes; each is ~230 MB |

---

## Sending things upstream

The smaller the fork, the cheaper every upgrade. One change here is not fork-specific and belongs
upstream:

- **`sseToJsonHandler.js`** — a non-streaming Claude-format client of any `forceStream` provider
  (opencode, zed, codebuddy, …) receives an OpenAI `chat.completion` body it cannot parse. The fix
  reuses the existing shared translator. Covered by `tests/unit/forced-sse-client-format.test.js`.

If upstream takes it, drop it from the fork and from `PATCHED_FILES` in the manifest — one less
file that can ever conflict.

---

## Keeping this document true

`scripts/fork/fork-manifest.mjs` is the source of truth. When the fork gains a file or an
integration point, add it there first — `verify-fork.mjs` then enforces it, and this document's
tables should be updated to match.
