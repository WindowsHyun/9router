 * Repairs Claude Code CLI accounts that an earlier "Check" switched off.

 * account carries its credential in CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN and has no such
 * file, so Check declared it signed out and wrote isActive:false /
 * testStatus:"pending" — disabling the only kind of account that works in a
 * container, and telling its owner to finish /login in a terminal that does not
 * exist there.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the accounts route so that both callers — the route
 * (on GET) and initializeApp (at boot) — import a plain module. Boot used to
 * import the route itself, which pulled `next/server` and a Next route export
 * into the startup path for no reason.
