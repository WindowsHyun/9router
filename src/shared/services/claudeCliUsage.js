/**
 * Quota for the Claude Code CLI provider.
 *
 * claude-cli appears in USAGE_ROUTED_PROVIDERS because its connections carry
 * authType "none" — the credential is local rather than held by this server.
 * That is a statement about auth, not about quota. The account behind it is an
 * ordinary Claude subscription, and the OAuth usage endpoint the `claude`
 * provider already reads answers for it: the same `five_hour` / `seven_day`
 * windows, the same `utilization` and `resets_at`.
 *
 * Reading it here is what gives the card a percentage, a progress bar and a
 * reset countdown like every other provider, instead of bare counters. It also
 * means the figures are the subscription's real remaining capacity rather than
 * this server's own tally.
 *
 * That endpoint is not open to every account. A credential from
 * `claude setup-token` — the only kind that works in a container — is refused
 * with "OAuth token does not meet scope requirement user:profile". Those
 * accounts are not without quota, though: the CLI reports the same two windows
 * on every routed request, and claudeCliRateLimits.js keeps the last ones seen.
 *
 * So there are three sources, in order of authority: the usage endpoint, the
 * windows the CLI last reported, and — for an account that has neither — a
 * count of what this server itself routed.
