// reaches the relay and no response comes back, and the CLI drops the
// connection thirty seconds later. That failure then locks the account for
// thirty seconds, so one bad request takes every request behind it with it.

// {"forwarded":1,"status":200} — the hang did not reproduce on a macOS host
// without a proxy. But it read back nothing past the system prompt: the replay
// folds history into the newest user turn, so the prefix diverges before any
