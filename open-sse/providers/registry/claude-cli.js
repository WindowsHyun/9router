/**
 * Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`)
 *
 * Runs the locally installed Claude Code binary instead of replaying OAuth
 * tokens against api.anthropic.com. Traffic is indistinguishable from an
 * ordinary Claude Code session, which is the point: the `claude` provider
 * carries a ban risk this one avoids.
 *
 * noAuth — credentials come from whatever `claude` is already logged into.
 * Text/reasoning only: the CLI's built-in tools are disabled and client tools
 * are not bridged (see executors/claude-cli.js).
